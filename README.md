COVID-19 Infection Prediction System


A comprehensive machine learning pipeline for predicting COVID-19 infections using clinical and demographic features. This project demonstrates end-to-end ML development including feature engineering, model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and statistical validation.


Project Overview
This project predicts COVID-19 test results (positive/negative) using patient clinical data including symptoms, vital signs, demographics, and medical history. The system achieves 97% accuracy and 0.995 ROC-AUC through advanced feature engineering and model optimization.
